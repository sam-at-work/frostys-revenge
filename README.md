These are instructions for AI to build a game:

Game title: Frosty;s Revenge

Game description:
I am making a Super Mario inspired 2-D game. It should use similar graphics level design and gameplay. The key differences are as follows. The main character is a snowman character. Enemies are elves you jump on them to kill them. The main character can also throw snowballs. When the snowballs hit the elves, it kills them. It should just be one level and at the end instead of the bowels are boss like a Mario, the boss is centre and he throws sparkly Christmas tree decorations instead of axes. You need to get past him to finish the game. The equivalent of a superstar in Mario in this game will be a super banana. It should look like a banana and works the same as a superstar when you touch it it will turn you into a banana.

The background image and the game should be snow covered pine trees and include an image of centre flying in the sky with his reindeer.

Technical information.
The game will run and web browsers and use the Excalibur game framework
The source code for Excalibur is located inside a folder called Excalibur and the parent folder of this one you should refer to the Excalibur repository to figure out how to build the game.
Game controls.
You will control the main character using the arrow keys and you can also use the WASD keys as an alternative space will make you shoot the snowballs note that you don't need a power up to be able to shoot snowballs. You're always able to shoot them lives work the same as in Mario once you've lost all your lives it's game over start and you will restart at the start of the level.
